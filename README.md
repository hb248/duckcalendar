# Duck Advent Calendar

## About
The **Duck Advent Calendar** is a playful web project built with Svelte and TypeScript to explore the framework, its Runes, and modern front-end workflows.

## Quickfacts
- **Pages:** Frontpage, Calendar, Doors  
- **Language support:** German & English  

## Features
- Advent calendar with duck-themed content  
- Language switcher (German/English)  
- Dark/Light mode toggle  
- Dynamic background images loaded via APIs  

## Known Issues
- Not all code uses Svelte 5 Runes consistently   
- Door protection is weak (date check only in JavaScript, no backend)  
- APIs occasionally run into CORS problems and should be replaced  

## Possible Improvements
- Refactor code to use Svelte 5 Runes consistently  
- Improve design with more detailed styling and animations  
- Add backend or stronger logic for door unlock protection  
- Replace/upgrade APIs to avoid CORS issues
